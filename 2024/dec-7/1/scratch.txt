- Each hand wins amount of the bid*rank
- Rank is determined by the best hand
  -eg. Given there are 5 hands 
  - strongest hand will have rank 5 
  - weakest hand will have rank 1 

Cards are ranked from strongest to weakest as follows:
- A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Hands are ranked from strongest to weakest as follows:
- Five of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA
- Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA
- Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332
- Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98
- Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432
- One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4
- High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456

IF two hands have the same rank, 
If two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.


TASK - Find the total winnings from the input file

Given

HAND  BID
QQQJA 483 = 3 of a kind - Q high
T55J5 684 = 3 of a kind - 5 high
KK677 28 = 2 pair - K high
KTJJT 220 = 2 pair - J high
32T3K 765 = 1 pair - T high

Output
483 * 5
684 * 4
28  * 3
220 * 2
765 * 1
