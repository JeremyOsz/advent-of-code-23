| is a vertical pipe connecting north and south.
- is a horizontal pipe connecting east and west.
L is a 90-degree bend connecting north and east.
J is a 90-degree bend connecting north and west.
7 is a 90-degree bend connecting south and west.
F is a 90-degree bend connecting south and east.
. is ground; there is no pipe in this tile.
S is the starting position of the animal; there is a pipe on this tile, but your sketch doesn't show what shape the pipe has.

Loop looks like:
.....
.F-7.
.|.|.
.L-J.
.....

Start in NW - Pipe shape is inferred by adjacent pipes
..... 
.S-7.
.|.|.
.L-J.
.....

Would actually look like
-L|F7
7S-7|
L|7||
-L-J|
L|-JF

And 

7-F7-     ..F7.
.FJ|7     .FJ|.
SJLL7     SJ.L7
|F--J     |F--J
LJ.LJ     LJ...


Task: get out ahead of the animal
- Find fathest point from start - by steps in loop

How many steps along the loop does it take to get from the starting position to the point farthest from the starting position?
