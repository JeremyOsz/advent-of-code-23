Hold 3ms, will travel 12mm
Hold 4ms, will travel 12mm
Hold 5ms, will travel 10mm
Hold 6ms, will travel 6mm
Hold 7ms, will travel 0mm


AGAIN

Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200

Current record is 9mm
2, 3, 4, 5, will all beat 9mm

RANGE to win 2-5
Ways to win 4

Second race winning range is 4-11
Ways to win is 8

Third race winning range is 11-19
Ways to win is 9
