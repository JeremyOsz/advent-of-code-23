You're riding a camel in a desert and suddenly see a sandstorm coming. The person with you, who just warned about ghosts, vanishes. There are documents in the camel's pouchesâ€”some with navigation instructions and others describing a network of labeled nodes. Your task is to use the left/right instructions to guide the camel through the network from node AAA to ZZZ and escape the haunted desert.

This format defines each node of the network individually. For example:

RL - This can be read as "R means the right element of the current node, and L means the left element of the current node." The current node is the node you are currently on. For example, if you are on AAA, then R means CCC and L means BBB.

The network is a directed graph, where each node has exactly two outgoing edges. The left and right elements of a node are the two outgoing edges. For example, if a node has the left element BBB and the right element CCC, then the node has two outgoing edges: BBB and CCC.

RL repeats until you reach ZZZ so RL can be read as RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)

SO - TASK = GET FROM AAA TO ZZZ

AAA - R is CCC
CCC - L is ZZZ

YAY - ZZZ

===============================

LLR

AAA = (BBB, BBB)
BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)

AAA - L is BBB
BBB - L is AAA
AAA - R is BBB
BBB - L is AAA
AAA - L is BBB
BBB - R is ZZZ
